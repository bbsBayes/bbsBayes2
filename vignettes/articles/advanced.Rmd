## Basic Status and Trend Analyses

bbsBayes2 provides functions for every stage of Breeding Bird Survey data
analysis.

### Data Retrieval

You can download BBS data by running `fetch_bbs_data`. This will save it to a
package-specific directory on your computer. You must agree to the terms and
conditions of the data usage before downloading. You only need run this function
once for each annual update of the BBS database.

``` {r, eval = !bbsBayes2::have_bbs_data()}
fetch_bbs_data()
```

### Data Preparation

#### Stratification

Stratification plays an important role in trend analysis. Use the `stratify()`
function for this job. Set the argument `by` to stratify by the following
options:

- `bbs_cws` -- Political region X Bird Conservation region intersection 
  (Canadian Wildlife Service [CWS] method)
- `bbs_usgs` -- Political region X Bird Conservation region intersection 
  (United Status Geological Survey [USGS] method)
- `bcr` -- Bird Conservation Region only
- `state` -- Political Region only
- `latlong` -- Degree blocks (1 degree of latitude X 1 degree of longitude)

```{r}
s <- stratify(by = "bbs_cws", species = "Hepatic Tanager")
```

#### Stan Data

Stan models require the data to be sent as a list depending on how the model is
set up. `prepare_data()` subsets the stratified data based on species and
wrangles relevant data to use for Stan models.

```{r}
p <- prepare_data(s, min_max_route_years = 5)
```

#### Model Data

To prepare to run the model, initialization parameters and other model
parameters need to be calculated based on the model and model variant chosen.
These are calculated in a separate step to provide more information for
troubleshooting as well as to allow more advanced customizations of these
parameters.

```{r}
md <- prepare_model(p, model = "gamye", heavy_tailed = TRUE)
```


### MCMC

Once the data has been prepared for Stan, the model can be run. This example has a sub-optimal number of iterations and chains. We recommend 1000 iterations and 4 chains. Note that this step usually takes a long time (e.g., 6-12 hours, or even days depending on the species,
model).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mod <- run_model(md, output_basename = "cws_base_gamye",
                 iter_sampling = 10, iter_warmup = 10, chains = 2)
```

Alternatively, you can set how many iterations for sampling or warm up steps, 
how many chains, and how many to run in parallel.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mod <- run_model(md, output_basename = "cws_base2_gamye",
                 iter_sampling = 1000, iter_warmup = 1000, 
                 chains = 4, parallel_chains = 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(piggyback)
pb_download("iris.tsv.gz", 
            repo = "cboettig/piggyback-tests", 
            dest = tempdir())

```


The `run_model()` function generates a large object that includes the posterior
draws, convergence information, data, etc. By default, this a copy of this
object is saved as an RDS file to your model directory (working directory unless
`output_dir` is specified.

You can load this in with
```{r, eval = FALSE}
readRDS("cws_base_gamye.rds")
```


### Convergence

The `run_model()` function will send a warning if Gelman-Rubin Rhat cross-chain
convergence criterion is \> 1.1 for any of the monitored parameters. Re-running
the model with a longer burn-in and/or more posterior iterations or greater
thinning rates may improve convergence. The seriousness of these convergence
failures is something the user must interpret for themselves. In some cases some
parameters of the model may not be separately estimable, but if there is no
direct inference drawn from those separate parameters, their convergence may not
be necessary. If all or the vast majority of the n parameters have converged
(e.g., you're receiving this warning message for other monitored parameters),
then inference on population trajectories and trends from the model are
reliable.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(bayesplot) #to visually check convergence

#load our Hepatic Tanager model, or create your own to test convergence
mod<-readRDS("~/Git/bbsBayes2/data/HETA_latlong_gam.rds")
#get convergence information
conv<-get_convergence(model_output = mod)
head(conv)

#get summaries 
summary(conv)

#visually check convergence
#create an array of mcmc runs
post<-as.array(mod$model_fit$draws())

##see model parameters
get_model_vars(mod)

#create density plots for any parameters, coloured by chain number
mcmc_dens_overlay(post,pars=c("STRATA","phi","retrans_obs","eta","nu","sdste"))

```

## Model Predictions

There are a number of tools available to summarize and visualize the posterior predictions from the model. 

### Annual Indices of Abundance and Population Trajectories 

The main monitored parameters are the annual indices of relative abundance within a stratum (i.e., parameters `n[strata,year]`). The time-series of these annual indices form the estimated population trajectories.

```{r}
indices <- generate_indices(mod)
```

By default, this function generates estimates for the continent (i.e., survey-wide) and for the individual strata. However, the user can also select summaries for composite regions (regions made up of collections of strata), such as countries, provinces/states, Bird Conservation Regions, etc. For display, the posterior medians are used for annual indices (instead of the posterior means) due to the asymetrical distributions caused by the log-linear retransformation.

```{r}
indices <- generate_indices(mod,
                            regions = c("continent","stratum"))          #also"country","prov_state","bcr","bcr_by_country"
#plot the indices
plot<-plot_indices(indices)
plot[[2]]
```

### Population Trends

Population trends can be calculated from the series of annual indices of abundance. The trends are expressed as geometric mean rates of change (%/year) between two points in time. $Trend = (\frac {n[minyear]}{n[maxyear]})^{(1/(maxyear-minyear))}$

```{r}
trends <- generate_trends(indices = indices,  
                          min_year = 1970,
                          max_year = 2018)
```

The `generate_trends()` function returns a dataframe with 1 row for each unit of the region-types requested in the `generate_indices()` function (i.e., 1 for each stratum, 1 continental, etc.). The dataframe has at least 27 columns that report useful information related to each trend, including the start and end year of the trend, lists of included strata, total number of routes, number of strata, mean observed counts, and estimates of the % change in the population between the start and end years.

The `generate_trends()` function includes some other arguments that allow the user to adjust the quantiles used to summarize uncertainty (e.g., interquartile range of the trend estiamtes, or the 67% CIs), as well as include additional calculations, such as the probability a population has declined (or increased) by \> X%.

```{r}
trends <- generate_trends(indices = indices,
                          min_year = 1970,
                          max_year = 2018,
                          prob_decrease = c(0, 25, 30, 50),
                          prob_increase = c(0, 33, 100))
```

## Visualizing Predictions

### Population Trajectories

Generate plots of the population trajectories through time. The `plot_indices()` function produces a list of ggplot figures that can be combined into a single pdf file, or printed to individual devices.

```{r}
tp <- plot_indices(indices = indices,
                   add_observed_means = TRUE)

tp[[1]]
```

<img src="man/figures/BARS_Continental_Trajectory.png"/>

```{r}
tp[[2]]
```

<img src="man/figures/BARS_Canada_Trajectory.png"/> etc.

### Trend Maps

The trends can be mapped to produce strata maps coloured by species population trends.

```{r}
mp <- plot_map(trends, col_viridis = FALSE)
mp
```

<img src="man/figures/BARS_trendmap.png"/>

### Geofacet Trajectories


```{r, eval = FALSE}
#load a model with prov_state in the regions to geofacet trajectories
#read the RDS file from bbsBayes2 github
basw<-readRDS("~/Git/bbsBayes2/data/Barn_Swallow_gamye_spatial.rds")
indices<-generate_indices(basw,regions=c("prov_state","country","stratum"))
trends<-generate_trends(indices)
gf <- plot_geofacet(indices=indices,
                    trends = trends,
                    multiple = TRUE,
                    slope = FALSE)

print(gf)
```

<img src="man/figures/BARS_geofacet.png"/>

## EXAMPLE - Replicating the CWS status and trend estimates (2018 version onwards)

The CWS analysis, as of the 2018 BBS data-version, uses the GAMYE model. It also monitors two estimates of the population trajectory: \* one for visualizing the trajectory that includes the annual fluctuations estimated by the year-effects "n" \* and another for calculation trends using a trajectory that removes the annual fluctuations around the smooth "n3".

The full script to run the CWS analysis for the 2018 BBS data version is accessible here: <https://github.com/AdamCSmithCWS/BBS_Summaries>

``` {.r}

species.eng = "Hepatic Tanager"

stratified_data <- stratify(by = "bbs_cws",species=species.eng) #same as USGS but with BCR7 as one stratum and PEI and Nova Scotia combined into one stratum

d<- prepare_data(strata_data = stratified_data,
                               min_max_route_years = 5
                               )

m<-prepare_model(
  prepared_data = d,
  model="gamye",
  heavy_tailed = TRUE,
  model_variant="hier"
)

mod_cws <- run_model( model_data = m,
                  refresh=100,
                      iter_sampling = 1000,
                      iter_warmup = 1000,
                     chains = 3,
                     parallel_chains = 1) 


```

## EXAMPLE - Replicating (approximately) the earlier USGS status and trend estimates (2011 - 2017 data versions)

The USGS analysis, from 2011 through 2017, uses the SLOPE model. Future analyses from the USGS will likely use the first difference model (see, Link et al. 2017 <https://doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-1.1>)

NOTE: the USGS analysis is not run using the bbsBayes2 package, and so this analysis may not exactly replicate the published version. However, any variations should be very minor.

``` {.r}

species.eng = "Hepatic Tanager"
stratified_data <- stratify(by = "bbs_usgs",species=species.eng) #BCR by province/state/territory intersections

d <- prepare_data(strata_data = stratified_data,
                               min_max_route_years = 1,
                               ) 
m<-prepare_model(prepared_data = d,
  model="slope",
  heavy_tailed = FALSE,
  use_pois = TRUE
)

mod <- run_model(model_data = m,
                      iter_sampling = 1000,
                      iter_warmup = 1000,
                      chains = 3,
                     parallel_chains = 1) 


```

## Advanced options and customized models

## Alternative Models

The package has (currently) four status and trend models that differ somewhat in the way they model the time-series of observations. The four model options are slope, gam, gamye, and firstdiff. <img src="man/figures/AMKE_all.png"/>

### slope

The slope option estimates the time series as a log-linear regression with random year-effect terms that allow the trajectory to depart from the smooth regression line. It is the model used by the USGS and CWS to estimate bbs trends since 2011. The basic model was first described in 2002 (Link and Sauer 2002; [https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2832:AHAOPC]2.0.CO;2](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B2832:AHAOPC%5D2.0.CO;2){.uri}) and its application to the annual status and trend estimates is documented in Sauer and Link (2011; <https://doi.org/10.1525/auk.2010.09220>) and Smith et al. (2014; <https://doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v128i2.1565>).

slope_plot[["continent"]] + non_slope_plot[["continent"]]
```

<img src="man/figures/AMKE_slope.png"/>

### gam

The gam option models the time series as a semiparametric smooth using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) structure. See <https://github.com/AdamCSmithCWS/Smith_Edwards_GAM_BBS> for more information (full publication coming soon)

``` {.r}

stratified_data <- stratify(by = "bbs_usgs",species="Scissor-tailed Flycatcher")
    
data_gam <- prepare_data(stratified_data, 
                              min_max_route_years = 3)
                              
gam_prep<-prepare_model(data_gam,model="gam")

#quick model with too few iterations, we recommend 1000 iterations and 3 chains
gam_mod <- run_model(gam_prep,save_model=FALSE, iter_warmup=20,iter_sampling=20, chains=2)
                               
gam_ind <- generate_indices(gam_mod,regions = c("continent"))
  
plot_indices(gam_ind)    
```

<img src="man/figures/AMKE_gam.png"/>

### gamye

The gamye option includes the semiparametric smooth used in the gam option, but also includes random year-effect terms that track annual fluctuations around the smooth. This is the model that the Canadian Wildlife Service is now using for the annual status and trend estimates.

``` {.r}

ye_strat<- stratify(by="bbs_usgs",species="Hepatic Tanager")
ye_dat<- prepare_data(ye_strat,min_max_route_years = 3)
ye_prep<-  prepare_model(ye_dat,model = "gamye")
ye_mod<- run_model(ye_prep, chains=3,iter_warmup = 20,iter_sampling = 20,save_model = FALSE)

gamye_ind <- generate_indices(model_output=ye_mod,
                              regions = c("continent"))
gamye_plot = plot_indices(indices = gamye_ind,
                          add_observed_means = TRUE)

print(gamye_plot)

```

<img src="man/figures/AMKE_gamye.png"/>

### firstdiff

The firstdiff option models the time-series as a random-walk from the first year, so that the first-differences of the sequence of year-effects are random effects with mean = 0 and an estimated variance. This model has been described in Link et al. 2017 <https://doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-1.1>

``` {.r}

stratified_data <- stratify(by = "bbs_usgs",species="Scissor-tailed Flycatcher")
    
data_gam<- prepare_data(stratified_data, 
                              min_max_route_years = 3)
                              
gamye_prep<-prepare_model(data_gam,model="gamye")

#quick model with too few iterations
gamye_mod <- run_model(gamye_prep,save_model=FALSE, iter_warmup=10,iter_sampling=20, chains=2)
                               
gamye_ind <- generate_indices(gamye_mod,regions = c("continent"))
  
plot_indices(gamye_ind)   
```

<img src="man/figures/AMKE_firstdiff.png"/>

## Alternate extra-Poisson error distributions

For all of the models, the BBS counts on a given route and year are modeled as Poisson variables with over-dispersion. The over-dispersion approach used here is to add a count-level random effect that adds extra variance to the unit variance:mean ratio of the Poisson. In the `prepare_model` function, the user can choose between two distributions to model the extra-Poisson variance:

-   the default normal distribution (`heavy_tailed = FALSE`)
-   an alternative heavy-tailed t-distribution. (`heavy_tailed = TRUE`)

The heavy-tailed version is well supported for many species, particularly species that are sometimes observed in large groups. Note: the heavy-tailed version can require significantly more time to converge (\~2-5 fold increase in processing time).

``` {.r}

strat<-stratify(by="bbs_usgs",species="Hepatic Tanager")
d<-prepare_data(strat,min_max_route_years = 3)
m<-prepare_model(d,model = "first_diff",heavy_tailed = TRUE)
mod<-run_model(model_data=m,chains=3,iter_warmup = 20,iter_sampling = 20,save_model = FALSE)

m2<-prepare_model(d,model = "first_diff",heavy_tailed = FALSE)
mod2<-run_model(model_data=m2,chains=3,iter_warmup = 20,iter_sampling = 20,save_model = FALSE)

#get heavy tailed plots
heavy_t<-mod %>%
generate_indices(regions="prov_state")%>%
plot_indices()

#get normal tailed plots
light_t<-mod2 %>%
generate_indices(regions="prov_state")%>%
plot_indices()

#compare plots
library(patchwork)
heavy_t[["TX"]]+light_t[["TX"]]
```

## Alternate Annual Indices and Resulting Trends

In all the models, the default measure of the annual index of abundance (the yearly component of the population trajectory) is the derived parameter "n". The `run_model` function monitors n by default, because it is these parameters that form the basis of the estimated population trajectories and trends.

### Alternate retransformations

There are two ways of calculating these annual indices for each model. The two approaches differ in the way they calculate the retransformation from the log-scale model parameters to the count-scale predictions. The user can choose using the following arguments in `run_model()` and `generate_indices()`.

-   the default, estimates the mean of the expected counts from the existing combinations of observers and routes in a given stratum and year. This approach retransforms an annual prediction for every observer-route combination in the stratum and then averages across those predictions.

``` {.r}

mod <- run_model(... ,
                 ... )
indices <- generate_indices(... ,
                            alternate_n = "n",
                            ... )
                            #or "n2", "n_smooth", "n_slope"
```

-   the alternative, alternate_n = "n2", is actually the standard approach used in the USGS status and trend estimates. It estimates the the expected count from a new observer-route combination, assuming the distribution of observer-route effects is approximately normal. This approach uses a log-normal retransformation factor that adds half of the estimated variance of observer-route effects to the log-scale prediction for each year and stratum, then retransforms that log-scale prediction to the count-scale. This is the approach described in Sauer and Link (2011; <https://doi.org/10.1525/auk.2010.09220>).

``` {.r}
mod <- run_model(... ,
                  ... )
indices <- generate_indices(... ,
                            alternate_n = "n2",
                            ... )
```

The default approach alternate_n = "n" slightly underestimates the uncertainty of the annual indices (slightly narrower CI width). However, we have chosen this approach as the default because:

-   it much more accurately represents the observed mean counts, and so allows for an intuitive interpretation of the annual indices;
-   it more accurately represents the relative contribution of each stratum to the combined (e.g., continental or national) population trajectory and trends. The alternative n2 approach tends to overestimate the observed mean counts, and that bias varies among strata, which affects each strata's contribution to the combined regional estimates.
-   the small underestimate in the uncertainty of the annual indices, does not affect the uncertainty of the trend estimates.

#### For example, in the figures below, the predicted annual indices (blue line and CI-band) are much more similar to the observed average counts (grey dots) for the Default n approach.

<img src="man/figures/Alternate_n_all.png"/>

### Decomposing the population trajectories for two of the models

For two of the main model types `"slope" and "gamye"`, users can choose two different ways to calculate trajectories and population trends. With these two model types, the population trajectories are composed of two largely independent components, a long-term smooth and the random annual fluctuations around that smooth. Because the two components are largely independent, the population trajectory can be decomposed.\
The default approach is to include the annual fluctuations around the linear (`slope`) or GAM-smooth (`gamye`) components of the trajectories. These trend estimates are more comprehensive in that they include the full estimated trajectory, but they will vary more between subsequent years (e.g., more variability between a 1970-2017 trend and a 1970-2018 trend), because they include the effects of the annual fluctuations.

``` {.r}
mod <- run_model(... ,
                   ... )
indices <- generate_indices(... ,
                            alternate_n = "n",
                            ... )
```

An alternative approach is to decompose the full trajectory and to exclude the annual fluctuations around the linear (`slope`) or smooth (`gamye`) components. In this case, the predicted trends will be much more stable between subsequent years. For the CWS status and trend analyses, the visualized population trajectories are calculated using the full trajectory, and the trend estimates are derived from the decomposed trajectory using only the smooth component.

``` {.r}
mod <- run_model(... ,
                  ... )
indices_visualize <- generate_indices(... ,
                                      alternate_n = "n",
                                      ... )
indices_trend_calculation <- generate_indices(... ,
                                              alternate_n = "n_smooth",
                                              ... )
```

For example, the figure below (produced using a modified version of the standard plotting functions), shows the two kinds of trajectories for Pacific Wren from the 2018 CWS analysis. The light-blue trajectory is the visualized trajectory, including the yearly fluctuations. The orange trajectory is the one used for trend calculations, which includes only the GAM-smooth component. For the kinds of broad-scale status assessments that form the primary use of the published estimates of trends, this decomposition is a particularly useful feature of these two models.

<img src="man/figures/PAWR_Canada.png"/>

#### The figure below provides another example of the benefits of removing the year-effect annual fluctuations when calculating trends.

Each point on the graph represents the 10-year trend estimate for Wood Thrush in Canada, ending in a given year (e.g., the points at 2015 represent the species national population trend from 2005-2015). The red and green points are the trend estimates from the default trend estimates derived from the full population trajectories for the gamye and slope models. The Blue points represent the trends calculated using the decomposed trajectory of the gamye model, including only the smooth component. When the annual fluctuations are included (SLOPE and GAMYE including Year Effects), the population trends surpass the IUCN trend-criterion, in some years (e.g., 2011) suggesting that if assessed in those years the species would be listed as Threatened (trend in the orange region). However, a more stable trend estimate from the decomposed trajectory (GAMYE - Smooth only in Blue) shows that the species is probably best thought of as in decline, but not surpassing the Threatened criterion.

<img src="man/figures/WOTH_status_assessment.png"/>

## Alternate Measures of Trend and Population Change

The `generate_trends()` function produces much more than just the trend estimates.

### Slope Trends

The default trend calculation is an interval-specific estimate of the geometric mean annual change in the population. $Trend = (\frac {n[Minyear]}{n[Maxyear]})^{(1/(Maxyear-Minyear))}$ It relies on a comparison of the annual indices in the first and last years of the trend period to quantify the mean rate of population change. However, it ignores the pattern of change between the two end-points.

The user can choose an alternative estimate of change that is calculated by fitting a log-linear slope to the series of all annual indices between the two end-points (e.g., all 11 years in a 10-year trend from 2008-2018). The slope of this line could be expressed as an average annual percent change across the time-period of interest. If working with estimates derived from a model with strong annual fluctuations and for which no decomposition is possible (e.g., "firstdiff" model), this slope-based trend may be a more comprehensive measure of the average population change, that is less dependent on the particular end-point years. These slope trends can be added to the trend output table by setting the `slope = TRUE` argument in `generate_trends()`. The standard trends are still calculated, but additional columns are added that include the alternate estimates. NOTE: the `plot_map()` function can map slope trends as well with the same `slope = TRUE` argument.

``` {.r}

strat<- stratify(by="bbs_usgs",species = "Cerulean Warbler")
p_dat<-prepare_data(strat, min_max_route_years = 3)
p_mod<-  prepare_model(p_dat, model = "first_diff",use_pois = TRUE)

first_mod<- run_model(p_mod, chains=3,iter_warmup = 20,iter_sampling = 20,save_model = FALSE)

firstdiff_ind <- generate_indices(model_output = first_mod,
                                regions = c("continent","stratum"))
                                
fd_slope_trends_08_18 <- generate_trends(indices = firstdiff_ind,
                                         min_year = 2008,
                                         max_year = 2018,
                                         slope = TRUE)
plot_map(fd_slope_trends_08_18,
         slope = TRUE)
```

### Percent Change and probability of change

The `generate_trends()` function also produces estimates of the overall percent-change in the population between the first and last years of the trend-period. This calculation is often easier to interpret than an average annual rate of change. These percent change estimates have associated uncertainty bounds, and so can be helpful for deriving statements such as "between 2008 and 2018, the population has declined by 20 percent, but that estimate is relatively uncertain and the true decline may be as little as 2 percent or as much as 50 percent"

In addition, the function can optionally calculate the posterior conditional probability that a population has changed by at least a certain amount, using the `prob_decrease` and `prob_increase` arguments. These values can be useful for deriving statements such as "our model suggests that there is a 95% probability that the species has increased (i.e., \> 0% increase) and a 45 percent probability that the species has increased more than 2-fold (i.e., \> 100% increase)"

``` {.r}

fd_slope_trends_prob <- generate_trends(indices = firstdiff_ind,
                                             min_year = 2008,
                                             max_year = 2018,
                                             slope = TRUE,
                                             prob_increase = c(0,100))
                                             
plot_map(fd_slope_trends_prob)                                                       
```

## Custom regional summaries

Yes, you can calculate the trend and trajectories for custom combinations of strata, such as the trends for Eastern and Western populations of the Barn Swallow.

``` {.r}
#using our downloaded Barn Swallow Gamye example
   
mod<-readRDS("~/Git/bbsBayes2/data/Barn_Swallow_gamye_spatial.rds")
    
    #get our stratification
stratification<-stratify(by="bbs_cws","Barn Swallow")
    
```

Assuming the above setup has been run. The user could then generate population trajectories using a customized grouping of the original strata.

First extract a dataframe that defines the original strata used in the analysis.

``` {.r}

st_comp_regions <- as.data.frame(stratification$meta_strata)
```

The add a column to the dataframe that groups the original strata into the desired custom regions.

``` {.r}

#regions with barn swallows
no_barn<- st_comp_regions$bcr[!(st_comp_regions$bcr %in% c(unique(mod$meta_strata$bcr)))]

st_comp_regions$East_West <- ifelse(st_comp_regions$bcr %in% c(7,8,12:14,22:31),"East","West")

#remove regions without Barn Swallows
st_comp_regions$East_West <- ifelse(st_comp_regions$bcr %in% c(no_barn),NA,st_comp_regions$East_West)

```

st_comp_regions can now be used as the dataframe input to the argument alt_region_names in `generate_indices()`, with "East_West" as the value for the argument regions. The relevant trends can be calculated using just the `generate_trends()` function.

``` {.r}

ew_indices<-generate_indices(model_output = mod,
                             regions = "East_West",
                             regions_index = st_comp_regions)
plot_indices(ew_indices)
east_west_trends <- generate_trends(indices = ew_indices)


mmm<-load_map(stratify_by = "bbs_cws")
#eastern strata

east<-c(st_comp_regions[st_comp_regions$East_West=="East",][,"strata_name"])

#plot trends by east_west
mmm$ew2<-ifelse(mmm$strata_name %in% c(east),"East","West")


#put the east and west trends into map
e_trend<-as.numeric(filter(east_west_trends$trends,region=="East")[,"trend"])
w_trend<-as.numeric(filter(east_west_trends$trends,region=="West")[,"trend"])

mmm$Trend<-ifelse(mmm$ew2 %in% "East",e_trend,w_trend)
#remove trends when not in barn swallow range
mmm$Trend<-ifelse(mmm$bcr %in% c(no_barn),NA,mmm$Trend)

#plot
ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=mmm,aes(fill=Trend))
  
```

## Exporting the Stan model

You can easily export any of the bbsBayes2 models to a text file.

``` {.r}

copy_model_file(
  model="gamye",model_variant = "hier",
  dir=tempdir()
)

unlink(file.path(tempdir(), "gamye_hier_bbs_CV_COPY.stan"))
```

Then, you can modify the model text (e.g., try a different prior) and run the modified model

``` {.r}

prep<- prepare_model(...,
        model_file="gamye_hier_bbs_CV_COPY.stan",
         ...
          )
          
mod<-run_model(prep,...)          
```

Details coming soon...

## Modifying the Stan model and data

You can even export the bbsBayes2 model as text, and modify it to add in covariates. For example a GAM smooth to estimate the effect of the day of year on the observations, or an annual weather covariate, or... Then add the relevant covariate data to the stan model object, and you're off! We'll add some more details and examples soon.

## Comparing Models

Finally, bbsBayes2 can be used to run Bayesian cross-validations. For example, the `get_final_values()` function is useful to provide an efficient starting point for a cross-validation runs, without having to wait for another full burn-in period.

Paper that includes an example of how to implement a cross-validation using bbsBayes.

Pre-print: <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.010215> Supplement: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/228419725.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/228419725)

NOTE: although bbsBayes includes functions to calculate WAIC, recent work has shown that WAIC performs very poorly with the BBS data (<https://doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-1.1>). We recommend a k-fold cross-validation approach, as in the above zenodo archive.
