Formal estimates meaning can estimate full posterior distribution, including point estimate associated uncertainty (credible limits). composite regions can defined based combination underlying strata used fit model. example, using custom stratification, can generate estimates political jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces), long can comfortably designate strata one jurisdictions. default, generate_indices() creates indices two levels “continent” (combination strata used analysis) “stratum” (estimates individual strata). two bbs stratifications (“bbs_usgs” “bbs_cws”), can also add “prov_state”, “bcr”, “bcr_by_country” (appropriate). custom stratification, can also add political jurisdictions /create regional divisions provide regions_index data frame. example, let’s imagine like calculate regional indices stratum, country, province/state, well custom division eastern western regions. First ’ll need tell function strata belong province state, belong ‘east’ ’west. ’ll start using helper function assign_prov_state(). function takes map strata assigns strata province state depending amount overlap. default warn amount overlap less 75%, case, lower cutoff 60%. plot gives us chance make quick assessment whether ’re happy various strata assigned.  Next ’ll define east/west divide hand. plot strata name, can pick eastern western.  western eastern strata seem split numerically, western strata numbers lower 50 greater 74, eastern strata numbers . ’ll add column rindex dataframe “east” “west” character names group strata. now double check correctly grouped strata!  supply rindex object regions_index argument generate_indices() function include relevant column names object regions. can plot population trajectories regions plot_indices().  Finally can even create geofaceted plots (possible case assigned strata Provinces States calculated indices regions). geofacet plots can useful visualizing population trajectories species broad ranges across many states provinces.","code":"rindex <- assign_prov_state(map, min_overlap = 0.6, plot = TRUE) ggplot(rindex) +   geom_sf(data = load_map(type = \"North America\")) +   geom_sf() +   geom_sf_text(aes(label = strata_name), size = 2) #> Warning in st_point_on_surface.sfc(sf::st_zm(x)): st_point_on_surface may not give correct results for longitude/latitude #> data rindex <- mutate(   rindex,   east_west = if_else(as.numeric(strata_name) < 50 | as.numeric(strata_name) > 74,                       \"west\",                       \"east\")) ggplot(data = rindex) +   geom_sf(data = load_map(type = \"North America\")) +   geom_sf(data = rindex, aes(fill = east_west), alpha = 0.5) i <- generate_indices(   m,   regions = c(\"stratum\", \"country\", \"prov_state\", \"east_west\"),   regions_index = rindex) #> Processing region stratum #> Processing region country #> Processing region prov_state #> Processing region east_west  t <- generate_trends(i) p <- plot_indices(i) names(p) #>  [1] \"1\"                        \"14\"                       \"17\"                       \"18\"                       #>  [5] \"2\"                        \"22\"                       \"24\"                       \"26\"                       #>  [9] \"27\"                       \"28\"                       \"29\"                       \"30\"                       #> [13] \"31\"                       \"32\"                       \"33\"                       \"34\"                       #> [17] \"35\"                       \"37\"                       \"38\"                       \"39\"                       #> [21] \"40\"                       \"41\"                       \"42\"                       \"43\"                       #> [25] \"44\"                       \"45\"                       \"46\"                       \"47\"                       #> [29] \"48\"                       \"49\"                       \"50\"                       \"51\"                       #> [33] \"52\"                       \"53\"                       \"54\"                       \"55\"                       #> [37] \"56\"                       \"62\"                       \"63\"                       \"64\"                       #> [41] \"66\"                       \"68\"                       \"72\"                       \"75\"                       #> [45] \"76\"                       \"77\"                       \"Canada\"                   \"United_States_of_America\" #> [49] \"AB\"                       \"AK\"                       \"MB\"                       \"ME\"                       #> [53] \"MT\"                       \"NB\"                       \"ND\"                       \"NL\"                       #> [57] \"NS\"                       \"NT\"                       \"NY\"                       \"ON\"                       #> [61] \"QC\"                       \"SD\"                       \"SK\"                       \"east\"                     #> [65] \"west\"  p[[\"east\"]] + p[[\"west\"]] plot_geofacet(i, trends = t, multiple = TRUE)"},{"path":"https://bbsbayes.github.io/bbsBayes2/articles/stratification.html","id":"subsetting-an-existing-stratification","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Subsetting an existing stratification","title":"Stratification","text":"general, often useful use data given species, even ’re interested trends portion species’ range (estimates observer effects informed data analysis).
