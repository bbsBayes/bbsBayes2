# bbsBayes2: Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of North American BBS Data

The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a long-running program
that seeks to monitor the status and trends of the breeding birds in
North America. Since its start in 1966, the BBS has accumulated over 50
years of data for over 500 species of North American Birds. Given the
temporal and spatial structure of the data, hierarchical Bayesian models
are used to assess the status and trends of these 500+ species of birds.
'bbsBayes2' allows you to perform hierarchical Bayesian analysis of BBS
data. You can run a full model analysis for one or more species that you
choose, or you can take more control and specify how the data should be
stratified, prepared for 'Stan', or modelled.
