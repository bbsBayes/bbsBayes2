# Save output of run_model()

This function closely imitates
[`cmdstanr::save_object()`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/fit-method-save_object.html)
but saves the entire model output object from
[`run_model()`](https://bbsbayes.github.io/bbsBayes2/reference/run_model.md)
which contains more details regarding data preparation (stratification
etc.).

## Usage

``` r
save_model_run(
  model_output,
  retain_csv = TRUE,
  path = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE,
  save_file_path = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- model_output:

  List. Model output generated by
  [`run_model()`](https://bbsbayes.github.io/bbsBayes2/reference/run_model.md).

- retain_csv:

  Logical Should the Stan csv files be retained. Defaults to TRUE if
  user calls function directly. However, when this function is called
  internally by `run_model` this is set to FALSE.

- path:

  Character. Optional file path to use for saved data. Defaults to the
  file path used for the original run.

- quiet:

  Logical. Suppress progress messages? Default `FALSE`.

- save_file_path:

  Character. file path and full file name, including .rds extension.

## Value

Nothing. Creates an `.rds` file at `path`.

## Details

Files are saved to `path`, or if not provided, to the original location
of the Stan model run files (if the original files exist).

[`copy_model_file()`](https://bbsbayes.github.io/bbsBayes2/reference/copy_model_file.md),
[`run_model()`](https://bbsbayes.github.io/bbsBayes2/reference/run_model.md)

## Examples

``` r
# By default, the model is saved as an RDS file during `run_model()`

# But you can also deliberately save the file (here with an example model)
save_model_run(pacific_wren_model, path = "my_model.rds")

# Clean up
unlink("my_model.rds")
```
