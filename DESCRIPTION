Description: The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a long-running
  program that seeks to monitor the status and trends of the breeding birds in
  North America. Since its start in 1966, the BBS has accumulated over 50 years 
  of data for over 500 species of North American Birds. Given the temporal and 
  spatial structure of the data, hierarchical Bayesian models are used to assess 
  the status and trends of these 500+ species of birds. 'bbsBayes2' allows you to perform 
  hierarchical Bayesian analysis of BBS data. You can run a full
  model analysis for one or more species that you choose, or you can take
  more control and specify how the data should be stratified, prepared
  for 'Stan', or modelled.
